The SL_Paths.xml file contains the user-configured custom root path folder location.  
It's value should ultimately be mirrored in the registry setting "ConfigFileDir".  It is not
adviseable that the file be modified directly.  It's value is set in the ServiceManager windows
application on the "General" tab.
