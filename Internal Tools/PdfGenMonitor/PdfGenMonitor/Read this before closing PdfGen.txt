PDFGenMonitor is a console application that determines if PDFGen is working by checking the timestamp of the PDFGen log file. PDFGenMonitor runs every 15 minutes as a Windows scheduled task. If PDFGen is manually closed and PDFGenMonitor remains scheduled, the monitor will restart the PDFGen application. To keep PDFGen closed, disable or delete the scheduled task first.
